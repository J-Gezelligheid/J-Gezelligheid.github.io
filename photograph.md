<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my 15-year swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].
